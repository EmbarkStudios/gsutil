A small, incomplete replacement for the official [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil).

</div>

## Why?

* You need to do basic GCS operations like uploading some objects for eg. CD, and don't need to do every possible thing you can do with GCS.
* You want a single binary with 0 system dependencies and a minimal footprint (the gcloud/gsutil install is over 100MiB, compressed, in addition to requiring a Python install)

## Why not?

* This binary only supports some operations, listed below, if you need other operations they need to be added, or you must use the official gsutil.

## Supported subcommands

* [cat](src/cat.rs) - [Downloads](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/objects/struct.Object.html#method.download) and prints an object to stdout.
* [cp](src/cp.rs) - Either [downloads](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/objects/struct.Object.html#method.download) an Object and stores it in a local file, or [uploads](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/objects/struct.Object.html#method.insert_multipart) a local file as an Object.
* [ls](src/ls.rs) - [Lists](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/objects/struct.Object.html#method.list) Objects.
* [signurl](src/signurl.rs) - [Creates](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/signed_url/struct.UrlSigner.html) a signed url for an Object.
* [stat](src/stat.rs) - [Shows](https://docs.rs/tame-gcs/latest/tame_gcs/objects/struct.Object.html#method.get) metadata for an Object.
